SLAM is the process by which a mobile robot can build a map of an environment and at the same time use this map to compute it's own location. The past decade has seen rapid and exciting progress in solving the SLAM problem together with many compelling implementations of SLAM methods. Part I of this tutorial (this paper), describes the probabilistic form of the SLAM problem, essential solution methods and significant implementations. Part II of this tutorial will be concerned with recent advances in computational methods and new formulations of the SLAM problem for large scale and complex environments.},

abstract = {This paper presents a framework for collaborative localization and mapping with multiple Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in unknown environments. Each MAV estimates its motion individually using an onboard, monocular visual odometry algorithm. The system of MAVs acts as a distributed preprocessor that streams only features of selected keyframes and relative-pose estimates to a centralized ground station. The ground station creates an individual map for each MAV and merges them together whenever it detects overlaps. This allows the MAVs to express their position in a common, global coordinate frame. The key to real-time performance is the design of data-structures and processes that allow multiple threads to concurrently read and modify the same map. The presented framework is tested in both indoor and outdoor environments with up to three MAVs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on real-time collaborative monocular SLAM, which has also been applied to MAVs.},

abstract = {Being able to build a map of the environment and to simultaneously localize within this map is an essential skill for mobile robots navigating in unknown environments in absence of external referencing systems such as GPS. This so-called simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem has been one of the most popular research topics in mobile robotics for the last two decades and efficient approaches for solving this task have been proposed. One intuitive way of formulating SLAM is to use a graph whose nodes correspond to the poses of the robot at different points in time and whose edges represent constraints between the poses. The latter are obtained from observations of the environment or from movement actions carried out by the robot. Once such a graph is constructed, the map can be computed by finding the spatial configuration of the nodes that is mostly consistent with the measurements modeled by the edges. In this paper, we provide an introductory description to the graph-based SLAM problem. Furthermore, we discuss a state-of-the-art solution that is based on least-squares error minimization and exploits the structure of the SLAM problems during optimization. The goal of this tutorial is to enable the reader to implement the proposed methods from scratch.},

abstract = {Finding the relationship between two coordinate systems using pairs of measurements of the coordinates of a number of points in both systems is a classic photogrammetric task. It finds applications in stereophotogrammetry and in robotics. I present here a closed-form solution to the least-squares problem for three or more points. Currently various empirical, graphical, and numerical iterative methods are in use. Derivation of the solution is simplified by use of unit quaternions to represent rotation. I emphasize a symmetry property that a solution to this problem ought to possess. The best translational offset is the difference between the centroid of the coordinates in one system and the rotated and scaled centroid of the coordinates in the other system. The best scale is equal to the ratio of the root-mean-square deviations of the coordinates in the two systems from their respective centroids. These exact results are to be preferred to approximate methods based on measurements of a few selected points. The unit quaternion representing the best rotation is the eigenvector associated with the most positive eigenvalue of a symmetric 4 Ã— 4 matrix. The elements of this matrix are combinations of sums of products of corresponding coordinates of the points.},

abstract = {In order to obtain optimal 3D structure and viewing parameter estimates, bundle adjustment is often used as the last step of feature-based structure and motion estimation algorithms. Bundle adjustment involves the formulation of a large scale, yet sparse minimization problem, which is traditionally solved using a sparse variant of the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm that avoids storing and operating on zero entries. This paper argues that considerable computational benefits can be gained by substituting the sparse Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in the implementation of bundle adjustment with a sparse variant of Powell's dog leg non-linear least squares technique. Detailed comparative experimental results provide strong evidence supporting this claim},

We introduce the concept of dynamic bagof-words, which is a novel form of query expansion based on finding cliques in the landmark co-visibility graph. The proposed approach avoids the - often arbitrary - discretisation of space from the robot's trajectory that is common to most image-based loop closure algorithms. Instead we show that reasoning on sets of co-visible landmarks leads to a simple model that out-performs pose-based or view-based approaches.

abstract = {The gold standard method for tridimensional reconstruction and camera localization from a set of images is well known to be Bundle Adjustment (BA). Although BA was regarded for years as a costly method restricted to the offline domain, several real time algorithms based on BA flourished in the last decade. However those algorithms were limited to perform SLAM in small scenes or only Visual Odometry. In this work we built on excellent algorithms of the last years to design from scratch a Monocular SLAM system that operates in real time, in small and large, indoor and outdoor environments, with the capability of wide baseline loop closing and relocalization, and including full automatic initialization. Our survival of the fittest approach to select the points and keyframes of the reconstruction generates a compact and trackable map that only grows if the scene content changes, enhancing lifelong operation. We present an exhaustive evaluation in 27 sequences from the most popular datasets achieving unprecedented performance with a typical localization accuracy from 0.2{\%} to 1{\%} of the trajectory dimension in scenes from a desk to several city blocks. We make public a ROS implementation.},

abstract = {State of the art visual SLAM systems have recently been presented which are capable of accurate, large-scale and real-time performance, but most of these require stereo vision. Important application areas in robotics and beyond open up if similar performance can be demonstrated using monocular vision, since a single camera will always be cheaper, more compact and easier to calibrate than a multi-camera rig. With high quality estimation, a single camera moving through a static scene of course effectively provides its own stereo geometry via frames distributed over time. However, a classic issue with monocular visual SLAM is that due to the purely projective nature of a single camera, motion estimates and map structure can only be recovered up to scale. Without the known inter-camera distance of a stereo rig to serve as an anchor, the scale of locally constructed map portions and the corresponding motion estimates is therefore liable to drift over time. In this paper we describe a new near real-time visual SLAM system which adopts the continuous keyframe optimisation ap- proach of the best current stereo systems, but accounts for the additional challenges presented by monocular input. In particular, we present a new pose-graph optimisation technique which allows for the efficient correction of rotation, translation and scale drift at loop closures. Especially, we describe the Lie group of similarity transformations and its relation to the corresponding Lie algebra.We also present in detail the systems new image processing front-end which is able accurately to track hundreds of features per frame, and a filter-based approach for feature initialisation within keyframe-based SLAM. Our approach is proven via large-scale simulation and real-world experiments where a camera completes large looped trajectories.},

abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and proteinâˆ’protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â‰¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},
